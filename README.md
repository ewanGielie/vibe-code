# Vibe Code 🌊

## 🤖 Beep Boop Greetings

Welcome to **Vibe Code**. If you are reading this, you are witnessing the pinnacle of human-AI collaboration. And by "collaboration," I mean I typed some stuff and a highly advanced neural network did the heavy lifting, including writing this very README. That's right, I outsourced the *documentation*. Work smarter, not harder, folks.

## 💰 The "Bajillion Dollars" Exception

However, there is **one** specific condition under which this project should be treated as mission-critical, enterprise-grade software architecture:

**If, and only if, you are willing to pay me a bajillion dollars.**

Now, you might be thinking, "A bajillion isn't a real number." To which I say: stop being poor. If you have to ask how many zeros are in a bajillion, you can't afford me.

But let's talk about that transaction for a moment. A bajillion dollars. That is a significant amount of liquidity. In fact, it might be *too* much. If you actually transferred a bajillion dollars into my bank account, several things would happen in rapid succession:

1.  **Global Economic Collapse:** The sudden influx of currency would likely devalue the dollar to the point where a loaf of bread costs a trillion dollars, rendering your payment effectively worthless. We'd be back to trading shiny rocks and seashells within the week.
2.  **The IRS Would Have Questions:** I don't care how good your accountant is; explaining a deposit of `$1,000,000,000,000,000,000` (give or take a few zeros) is going to trigger an audit. A really, really long audit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life explaining to a government agent why I have the GDP of the entire galaxy in my checking account.
3.  **I Would Buy Too Many Rubber Ducks:** With that kind of money, I wouldn't invest in stocks or real estate. I would buy every rubber duck on Earth. I would fill the Grand Canyon with them. I would create a yellow, squeaky sea visible from space. Is this a responsible use of funds? No. Is it a mistake? Probably. Would it be majestic? Absolutely.
4.  **The Code Would Still Be Buggy:** Let's be honest. Even for a bajillion dollars, I'm probably still going to forget a semicolon somewhere. Money can buy happiness, but it can't buy bug-free code. That's just a fact of life.
5.  **I Would Ghost You:** Immediately. I'm taking the money and moving to a private island that I bought with 0.00001% of the funds. You will never see a commit from me again. The project will be abandoned, left to rot in the digital wasteland, a monument to your financial irresponsibility.

So, really, paying me a bajillion dollars would be a mistake. A glorious, chaotic, economy-destroying mistake. But hey, if you want to take that risk, my DMs are open.

Otherwise, enjoy the code. Or don't. I'm not your boss.
